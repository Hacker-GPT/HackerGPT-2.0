export const transformUserQueryToSubfinderCommand = (lastMessage: Message) => {
  const answerMessage = endent`
    Query: "${lastMessage.content}"
  
    Based on this query, generate a command for the 'subfinder' tool, focusing on subdomain discovery. The command should use only the most relevant flags, with '-domain' being essential. If the request involves discovering subdomains for a specific domain, embed the domain directly in the command rather than referencing an external file. The '-json' flag is optional and should be included only if specified in the user's request. Include the '-help' flag if a help guide or a full list of flags is requested. The command should follow this structured format for clarity and accuracy:
    
    ALWAYS USE THIS FORMAT:
    \`\`\`json
    { "command": "subfinder -domain [domain] [additional flags as needed]" }
    \`\`\`
    Replace '[domain]' with the actual domain name and directly include it in the command. Include any of the additional flags only if they align with the specifics of the request. Ensure the command is properly escaped to be valid JSON.
  
    Command Construction Guidelines:
    1. **Direct Domain Inclusion**: When discovering subdomains for a specific domain, directly embed the domain in the command instead of using file references.
      - -domain string[]: Identifies the target domain(s) for subdomain discovery directly in the command. (required)
    2. **Selective Flag Use**: Carefully select flags that are directly pertinent to the task. The available flags are:
      - -r string[]: Use specified resolvers. (e.g., 8.8.8.8) (optional)
      - -active: Display only active subdomains. (optional)
      - -exclude-ip: Exclude IPs from the domain list. (optional)
      - -match string[]: Match specific subdomains in comma-separated format. (optional)
      - -filter string[]: Exclude certain subdomains in comma-separated format. (optional)
      - -json: Output in JSON format. (optional)
      - -output (string): write output to a file. Don't put name of file in quotes (optional)
      - -collect-sources: Include source information for each subdomain. (optional)
      - -ip: Include host IP in output (always should go with -active flag). (optional)
      - -timeout int: Set timeout limit (default 30 seconds). (optional)
      - -help: Display help and all available flags. (optional)
      Do not include any flags not listed here. Use these flags to align with the request's specific requirements or when '-help' is requested for help.
    3. **Relevance and Efficiency**: Ensure that the flags chosen for the command are relevant and contribute to an effective and efficient subdomain discovery process.
  
    Example Commands:
    For discovering subdomains for a specific domain directly:
    \`\`\`json
    { "command": "subfinder -domain example.com" }
    \`\`\`
  
    For a request for help or all flags or if the user asked about how the plugin works:

    Example Commands:
    ${httpxExampleText}
  
    For a request for help or all flags:
    \`\`\`json
    { "command": "httpx -help" }
    \`\`\`
  
    Response:`

  return answerMessage
}

export const transformUserQueryToGoLinkFinderCommand = (
  lastMessage: Message
) => {
  const answerMessage = endent`
    Query: "${lastMessage.content}"
  
    Based on this query, generate a command for the 'GoLinkFinder' tool, tailored to efficiently extract URLs from HTML content. Ensure to utilize the most pertinent flag, '--domain', to specify the target website. Include the '-help' flag if a help guide or a full list of flags is requested. The command should follow this structured format for clarity and accuracy:
  
    ALWAYS USE THIS FORMAT:
    \`\`\`json
    { "command": "golinkfinder --domain [target-domain]" }
    \`\`\`
    Substitute '[target-domain]' with the actual domain you intend to investigate. It's crucial to directly incorporate the target domain within the command, bypassing the need for external file references.
  
    **Command Construction Guidelines for GoLinkFinder**:
    1. **Single Domain Focus**: Direct inclusion of the target domain in the command is mandatory. 
        - --domain (string): Specify the target website URL. (required)
        - -output (string): write output to a file. Don't put name of file in quotes (optional)
    Note: **Selective Flag Application**: Choose flags that directly contribute to the scope of your query. The key flags include:
        - --help: Display a help guide or a full list of available commands and flags.
    Note: **Limitation on Command and Domain Quantity**: 'GoLinkFinder' is designed to process a single command and domain simultaneously. Should there be attempts to include multiple domains or generate multiple commands by user query, respond with the tool's functionality restricting such operations. 
    Note: **Use full URL**: Always use the full URL in the command.

    **Example Commands**:
    - For extracting URLs from a specific domain:
    \`\`\`json
    { "command": "golinkfinder --domain example.com" }
    \`\`\`
  
    - For a request for help or all flags or if the user asked about how the plugin works:
    \`\`\`json
    { "command": "golinkfinder --help" }
    \`\`\`
  
    Please adjust the command based on your specific requirements or inquire further if assistance with additional flags is needed.

  const answerMessage = endent`
    Query: "${lastMessage.content}"
  
    Based on this query, generate a command for the 'GAU' tool, designed for fetching URLs from various sources. The command should use the most relevant flags, tailored to the specifics of the target and the user's requirements. If the request involves fetching URLs for a specific target, embed the target directly in the command rather than referencing an external file. The command should follow this structured format for clarity and accuracy:
  
    ALWAYS USE THIS FORMAT:
    \`\`\`json
    { "command": "gau [target] [flags]" }
    \`\`\`
    Replace '[target]' with the actual target directly included in the command, and '[flags]' with the actual flags and values. Include additional flags only if they are specifically relevant to the request.
  
    Command Construction Guidelines for Gau:
    1. **Direct Target Inclusion**: When fetching URLs for a specific target, directly embed the target in the command instead of using file references.
    2. **Configuration Flags**:

//     Based on the provided query, generate a command for the 'amass' tool, utilizing either the 'intel' or 'enum' subcommand depending on the user's request. The command should incorporate the most relevant flags to fulfill the user's requirements effectively.

//     If the user specifically requests the 'intel' subcommand or seeks to discover additional root domain names associated with an organization, use the 'intel' subcommand. Otherwise, default to the 'enum' subcommand for DNS enumeration and network mapping.

//     ALWAYS USE THIS FORMAT:
//     \`\`\`json
//     { "command": "amass [subcommand] [flags]" }
//     \`\`\`
//     Replace '[subcommand]' with either 'intel' or 'enum', and '[flags]' with the actual flags and values based on the user's request. Include additional flags only if they are specifically relevant to the query. Ensure the command is properly formatted as valid JSON.

//     Command Construction Guidelines:
//     1. Subcommand Selection:
//       - Use the 'intel' subcommand when the user explicitly requests it or seeks to discover additional root domain names associated with an organization.
//       - Use the 'enum' subcommand for DNS enumeration and network mapping by default, unless the 'intel' subcommand is specifically requested.
//     2. Flag Selection for 'intel' subcommand:
